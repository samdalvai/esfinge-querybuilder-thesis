# Bookstore App

This folder contains two versions of the same application. Both versions use the [Esfinge Querybuilder](http://esfinge.sourceforge.net/Query%20Builder.html) framework for creating the persistence layer, one uses QueryBuilder JDBC, the other QueryBuilder Cassandra.

## Original application

The framework of the application is based on the BookStore app, which is a Java Servlet CRUD tutorial that can be found at this [website](https://www.codejava.net/coding/jsp-servlet-jdbc-mysql-create-read-update-delete-crud-example).
